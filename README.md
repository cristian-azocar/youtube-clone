# YouTube clone

A clone of the YouTube website made with plain HTML, CSS and JS.

The idea was conceived as a personal challenge: to build a relative complex website from scratch without using any framework or library, just good old vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

This is still WIP. At the moment there is only the home page, and only the menu button is interactive, everything else is static.
